Printed allows you to create big header posts with a custom image. Everything's responsive of course and really easy to use. Just include a <code>header</code> with the url to your picture in your posts front matter like this:

{% highlight html %}
---
title: Your post
header: url_to_image
---
{% endhighlight %}

The whole theme is built on top of <a target="_blank" href="http://tachyons.io">Tachyons</a>. A really fast and easy to use css framework.
